# Notes

## My plan

- import csv file into file

- format csv data into what is wanted for inserting into the database
  - make name / surname capitalised
  - emails to lowercase
  - validate emails before inserting
    - if invalid, do not insert, error message to STDOUT


- add database stuff to file & add csv file to db
  - connect
  - table
  - insert
  - execute
  - commit
  - close

- script command line directives

- robust
- handles errors and exceptions gracefully
